// if a number is possible only in a certain `country` among several `countries`
// that share the same "country calling code", that function would check
// the possibility of the phone number only in the "main" `country` for the "country calling code"

//
// For example, "+1310xxxx" numbers are valid in Canada.
// However, they are not possible in the US due to being too short.
// Since Canada and the US share the same country calling code — "+1" —
// `checkNumberLength()` function used to return not "IS_POSSIBLE" for "+1310xxxx" numbers.
//
// In such cases, when using "/max" metadata, `isValid()` could output `true`
// but at the same time `isPossible()` could output `false`, which was contradictory.
//
// See https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/335892662 for the discusson in Google's issues.

// The solution suggested by Google was implemented: an optional `country` argument

// For some reason Google's metadata contains `<intlFormat/>`s with brackets and dashes.
// Meanwhile, there's no single opinion about using punctuation in international phone numbers.
//
// For example, Google's `<intlFormat/>` for USA is `+1 213-373-4253`.
// And here's a quote from WikiPedia's "North American Numbering Plan" page:
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan
//
// "The country calling code for all countries participating in the NANP is 1.
// In international format, an NANP number should be listed as +1 301 555 01 00,
// where 301 is an area code (Maryland)."
//
// I personally prefer the international format without any punctuation.
// For example, brackets are remnants of the old age, meaning that the
// phone number part in brackets (so called "area code") can be omitted
// if dialing within the same "area".
// And hyphens were clearly introduced for splitting local numbers into memorizable groups.
// For example, remembering "5553535" is difficult but "555-35-35" is much simpler.
// Imagine a man taking a bus from home to work and seeing an ad with a phone number.
// He has a couple of seconds to memorize that number until it passes by.
// If it were spaces instead of hyphens the man wouldn't necessarily get it,
// but with hyphens instead of spaces the grouping is more explicit.
// I personally think that hyphens introduce visual clutter,
// so I prefer replacing them with spaces in international numbers.
// In the modern age all output is done on displays where spaces are clearly distinguishable
// so hyphens can be safely replaced with spaces without losing any legibility.

// This "state" object simply holds the state of the "AsYouType" parser:
//
// * `country?: string` — The exact country of the phone number, if it could be determined.
//                        When inputting a phone number in "international" format, it will derive the `country` from "country calling code" and the phone number digits.
//                        When inputting a phone number in "national" format, it will derive the `country` from `defaultCountry` that was specified when creating the `AsYouType` formatter.
//                        Sidenote: If `USE_NON_GEOGRAPHIC_COUNTRY_CODE` flag was `true`, then for "non-geographic phone numbers" `state.country` would've been "001".
// * `callingCode?: string` — "Country calling code" that has been extracted from the input phone number.
//                        When inputting a phone number in "international" format, it will extract the "country calling code" from the digits that follow the "+" character.
//                        When inputting a phone number in "national" format, `callingCode` will be `undefined`.
//                        Sidenote: `state.callingCode` is therefore independent from `state.country` and there could be situations when `state.country` is defined by `state.callingCode` is not — that would be when inputting a phone number not in "international" format.
// * `digits: string` — Phone number digits that have been input so far, including the "+" character, if present. In case of inputting non-arabic digits, those will be converted to arabic ones.
// * `international: boolean` — Whether the phone number is being input in "international" format, i.e. with a "+" character.
// * `missingPlus: boolean` — Whether it's a phone number in "international" format that is missing the leading "+" character for some reason — apparently, Google thinks that it's a common mistake when inputting a phone number.
// * `IDDPrefix?: string` — An "IDD prefix", when the phone number is being input in an "out-of-country dialing" format. https://wikitravel.org/en/International_dialling_prefix
// * `carrierCode?: string` — A "carrier code", if the phone number contains it. Normally, those can only be present in Colombia or Brazil, and only when calling from mobile phones to fixed-line numbers.
// * `nationalPrefix?: string` — "National prefix", if present in the phone number input.
// * `nationalSignificantNumber?: string` — National (significant) number digits that have been input so far.
// * `nationalSignificantNumberIsModified: boolean` — Tells if the parsed national (significant) number is present as-is in the input string. For example, when inputting "0343515551212999" Argentinian mobile number, the parsed national (significant) number is "93435551212999". There, one can see how it stripped "0" national prefix and prepended a "9", because that's how it is instructed to do in Argentina's metadata. So in the described example, the parsed national (significant) number is not present as-is in the input string. Instead, it's "modified" in the input string. https://gitlab.com/caamphetamine/libphonenumber-js/-/blob/master/METADATA.md#national_prefix_for_parsing--national_prefix_transform_rule
// * `prefixBeforeNationalSignificantNumberThatIsNotNationalPrefix?: string` — In some countries, a phone number could have a prefix that is not a "national prefix" but rather some other type of "utility" prefix.
//                                                                             For example, when calling within Australia, one could prepend `1831` prefix to hide caller's phone number.
//                                                                             https://gitlab.com/catamphetamine/libphonenumber-js/-/blob/master/METADATA.md#national_prefix_for_parsing--national_prefix_transform_rule

// being formatted via `metadata[country].national_prefix_transform_rule`.
// For example, for `VI` country, it prepends `340` to the national number,

// https://github.com/catamphetamine/libphonenumber-js/issues/318

// In the original Google's code, the comments say:
// "Check that we didn't remove nor add any extra digits when we matched
// this formatting pattern. This usually happens after we entered the last
// digit during AYTF. Eg: In case of MX, we swallow mobile token (1) when
// formatted but AYTF should retain all the number entered and not change
// in order to match a format (of same leading digits and length) display
// in that way."
// "If it's the same (i.e entered number and format is same), then it's
// safe to return this in formatted number as nothing is lost / added."
// Otherwise, don't use this format.
